In this project, we will be exploring the following questions:
1. How are injuries and fatalities related to population? Distance (length) of landslide?
2. What landslide types are most fatal? Longest? Same for landslide trigger. 
3. How does landslide fatality, length, trigger, and time of year vary globally? (Use of maps) 
4. Is there any seasonal behavior with landslides/check the frequency of landfalls in different location? (Make use of time series analysis)
